<!--
    force-sobject element wraps the SmartSync Force.SObject into a polymer element.
    Why: a) Auto manages the offline store for caching.
    b) Provides a simpler DOM based interface to interact with Smartsync SObject Model.
    c) Allows other polymer elements to easily comsume smartsync.

    @attributes:
    sobject: (Required) Type of sobject on which you want to fetch the record
    recordid: (Required) Id of the record that needs to be fetched.
    fieldlist: (Optional) Default: All fields. List of field names that need to be fetched for the record.
    autosync: (Optional) Default: true. Auto synchronize (fetch/save) changes to the model with the remote server/local store. If false, use fetch/save methods to commit changes to server or local store. (TBD: autosync not working for "save" operations)
    mergemode: (Optional) Default: "Overwrite". The merge model to use when saving record changes to salesforce.

    @methods:
    fetch: Initiate the fetching of record data from the relevant data store (server/offline store).
    save: Initiate the saving of record data to the relevant data store (server/offline store).
    destroy: Initiate the deleting of record data from the relevant data store (server/offline store).

    @events:
    sync: when the data has been successfully synced with the server.
    destroy: when a record is deleted.
    error: when a request to remote server has failed.
    invalid: when the data validation fails on the client.
